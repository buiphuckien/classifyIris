This project shows how to use machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers. It contains three files that illustrate three regular algorithms normally used for classification problems.

    decisionTree.ipynb depicts how to apply decision tree to a classification problem. At the end of the file, I visualize the tree to help us better understand the scene behind the model.
    
    naiveBayes.ipynb displays the way to apply naive Bayes theorem to categorize the flowers. This algorithm doesn't use much of computation. Additionally, it is widely used in academia.
    
    logisticRegression.ipynb exhibits how to use linear model for the classification problems. This method works only for binary classifier. However, We can use one extension of it - one vs rest - for the multiclassification ploblems.
    
    iris.csv is - as its extension suggests - a file that contains the data set used for this project. It is really a popular among data science.
    
By modestly modifying the code, you can use it for your own problems.
